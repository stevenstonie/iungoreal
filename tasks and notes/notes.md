- to add in the project documentation: 
	- create a file "credentials" in %USERPROFILE%\.aws
	- the settings for the properties-dev.yml
	- necessary plugins / applications

- task ideas:
	- app time restriction
	- calendar for events
	- users can pin their recollections on the map (probably a private map for each user)
	- news section
	- friend requests older than 1 year should be removed
	- check what would happen with entries in tables such as friendships if users would be banned or accounts would be removed

- todos:
	- security
	- documentation
	- caching
		- reason1: performance (ex: db -> notifications table)
	- monitoring
	- scalability
	- performance
	- integrate design patterns
	- see where you put that calendar
	- see a weather location api for the map
